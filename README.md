MD-school-performance-PDF-heading-scraper
=========================================

Script designed at ScraperWiki / Washington Post / American University Data Journalism DC Camp.

This scraper pulls the heading information from Maryland Elementary School PDF file from montgomeryschoolsmd.org In addition to the basic school info, it also geocodes the address for easy mapping. Still a bit buggy, but was able to extract and map 124 schools.
